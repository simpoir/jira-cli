Jira command line interface
===========================

* because I use jira
* because it has a nice REST api
* because I needed a sandbox project to test ideas
* because I could not find any other jira-cli

There you have it! If it is of any use to you, feel free to drop me a line.
I'll maybe continue extending this... maybe, no promises
